# Fridge Inventory

## Why is this project of interest to you?

This project is of interest to me because I recently started cooking for myself this semester and I often find myself struggling to remember what ingredients I have and when I should eat them by. This leads to perishables sitting in the back of my fridge longer than they should, causing fruit and veg to become mushy and creating more food waste than wanted. A fridge inventory application can help solve this problem by reminding me of what I already have and further inspiring meal choices. There is also the benefit of being easily accessbile while away from home, allowing the user to keep an eye on the items in the fridge while physically outside and can help with creating shopping lists. 

## Who will use it?

This application is designed for anyone who struggles with keeping track of what perishables are in their fridge and using them before they spoil. Speficially, this application can be of help for new cooks, such as students, who want to better plan their meals, reduce food waste, and manage their produce.
