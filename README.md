# Digital Recipe Book


## The application will be able to:
- name recipes
- add ingredients 
- add recipe to a list or "recipe book" and access it
- add instructions regarding how to prepare the dish
- go through each step in the instructions when accessing the recipe


## Why is this project of interest to you?

This project is of interest to me because I recently started cooking for myself this semester and I often find myself struggling to visualize what ingredients I have and what dishes I can make with them. Online recipes are helpful, but lack the ability to record any changes I make to the predetermined recipe. Storing all the links also tend to get disorganized fast. By creating a recipe book that I can look through and edit based on my taste or experiences. Furthermore, it can greatly help me in deiciding what to make for my meals and develop my cooking skills further. The recipe book also being digital provides accessibility, easily allowing the recipes be transported from kitchen to kitcheb with ease. 

## Who will use it?

This application is designed for anyone who wants a digital recipe book, whether it be a seasoned cook or beginner, like me, who wants to start their cooking joureny.
